Data Mining Project - Prediction of Dengue Cases Using Weather and Web-Search Data in San Juan, Puerto Rico

1. Source Code

There are two ways to check the source code:
- You can open the Jupyter Notebook file data_analysis_dengue_forecast.ipynb on this git hub respository. But on GitHub it is not possible to execute it.

- Or you can open the link below (binder) and be able to also execute the code. The binder takes some minutes to open, because it installs the necessary packages on the fly.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Joglas/data_mining_project/master?filepath=data_analysis_dengue_forecast.ipynb)

For running the code on Jupyter, press shift enter in each one of the cells or on the menu select Cell -> Run All for runing the whole code.
